This repo is a test for me to work out a good full-stack app for Angular 2.

## Getting Started

1. `git clone git@github.com:jeffwhelpley/fullstack.git`
1. `cd fullstack`
1. `npm run build`
1. `npm run web`
1. Open up browser to [http://localhost:9998](http://localhost:9998)
1. If you feel like running tests, run `npm test`

## ToDos

1. Separate out providers_node from app_injector (so can be used in decorators)
1. Upgrade deps
1. Get working with basic server rendering
1. Start working on tickets
